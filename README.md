# Adaptive Ambient Beacon (AAB) üéìüìñ

## Overview: Repurposing Procedural Memory for Objective Data

The **Adaptive Ambient Beacon (AAB)** is a dedicated research platform that employs **Tangible User Interface (TUI)** principles to objectively measure cognitive responses in ageing populations and individuals with sensory or cognitive decline. Unlike traditional smart home technologies‚Äîwhich often rely on screens, complex menus, or smartphones‚Äîthis system leverages the robust, **low-cognitive-load pathway of procedural memory** via a highly familiar interaction method.

The AAB integrates a **high-fidelity sensor suite** (measuring Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and Micro-climate shifts) with a **Tangible Feedback Unit (TFU)**‚Äîa custom device designed to look and function exactly like a traditional analogue radio. This decouples the research mechanism from the obsolescence of commercial broadcast standards (FM/DAB).

Environmental deviations detected by the sensor suite (e.g., **BME680**) trigger **Subtle Audio Modulation** on a self-contained, low-power FM frequency broadcast internally within the TFU. Users perform a familiar physical action‚Äî**adjusting the tuning dial**‚Äîto resolve the audio cue and restore clarity. This provides **objective, non-verbal confirmation of awareness**, suitable for users who struggle with complex digital interfaces or declarative memory tasks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical System Outline & FM-based Tangible Feedback

The design emphasizes **Simplicity, Robustness, and Safe, Low-Power Operation**, ensuring reliable long-term use.

### 1. Decoupling Mechanism & FM-based Tangible Feedback (The TFU)

The **Tangible Feedback Unit (TFU)** contains a **low-power FM transmitter and receiver loop** internally. Even though the system is self-contained, this design choice is **central to the research methodology**:

- **Preserving Familiar Interaction Patterns**: Older adults are accustomed to tuning a physical radio dial to restore signal clarity. Using an FM broadcast internally preserves this natural, procedural interaction‚Äîturning the knob genuinely affects a signal, rather than just triggering a digital audio file.

- **Dynamic Layered Modulation**: FM transmission allows subtle frequency shifts and overlay tones to indicate different environmental deviations:
  - **Macro-State**: Gradual changes in IAQ (chronic trends)  
  - **Micro-State**: Acute spikes in VOCs or fumes  
  These cues require procedural resolution, i.e., tuning the dial to restore audio clarity.

- **Accurate Kinesthetic Feedback**: By separating the **signal generation (transmitter)** from the **signal reception (receiver/speaker)**, the system can precisely log **user interaction** (knob movements), which is critical for objective research measurements.

- **Future Scalability**: The FM-based approach allows multiple TFUs in one space to receive the same signal, making the system easily extendable for multi-room or multi-user studies.

- **Safety & Regulatory Compliance**: The internal FM broadcast operates on a **low-power, legally safe frequency**, fully contained within the TFU chassis. It ensures reproducible, controlled experiments without relying on external radio infrastructure.

**Benefit**: The FM loop transforms a simple environmental cue into a **tangible, procedural task** that is measurable, familiar, and low-stress for participants, while maintaining full control over the signal for research purposes.

### 3. FM Cue Resolution and Procedural Feedback

- **Subtle Modulation**: Gentle onset of audio signals rather than abrupt alarms.
- **Layered Feedback**:
  - **Layer 1**: Frequency modulation indicates chronic IAQ changes (macro-state)
  - **Layer 2**: Tone texture modulation signals acute fume spikes (micro-state)
- **Procedural Confirmation**: Turning the dial provides low-cognitive-load confirmation of awareness, logging **kinesthetic feedback** essential for research.

## üßì Application for Gerontology Research

### 1. Addressing Sensory and Cognitive Decline

- **Non-Visual Cue**: Audio-based, suitable for visual impairment.
- **Familiarity**: Leverages radio-tuning interactions familiar to older generations.
- **Low Cognitive Load**: Single action confirms awareness, minimizing executive load.
- **Minimising Anxiety**: Subtle modulation reduces stress compared to loud alarms.

### 2. Benefits for Dementia Care

- **Harnessing Procedural Memory**: Physical tuning bypasses impaired declarative memory.
- **Binary Feedback**: Simple interaction: `Audio noticeable ‚Üí Adjust dial ‚Üí Audio clear`.
- **User Agency**: Optional **Comfort Calibration** button allows baseline reset.

### 3. Predictive Context (Adaptive Baseline)

- ESP32 integrates a predictive model for a personalised home environment baseline.
- **Reduces Alert Fatigue**: Ignores normal fluctuations (e.g., routine cooking).
- **Maintains Trust**: Cues only trigger on genuine environmental changes.

## üìä Interaction Logging for Research Use

### Overview

In the Adaptive Ambient Beacon (AAB) system, **user interaction logging** serves as the bridge between **environmental sensing** and **behavioural measurement**. This feature enables researchers in **gerontology** and **human‚Äìcomputer interaction (HCI)** to quantitatively study awareness, responsiveness, and procedural cognition in ageing populations or individuals with cognitive decline ‚Äî without relying on complex digital interfaces or verbal tasks.

### Concept

The AAB transforms subtle environmental deviations into a **familiar, tangible tuning task**. When the environment changes (e.g., VOC or IAQ shifts), a mild FM distortion occurs within the Tangible Feedback Unit (TFU). Users instinctively turn the radio dial to restore clarity ‚Äî a deeply familiar, procedural action. This moment of interaction is what the system logs and quantifies.

### Logged Data

| Data Point | Description | Research Use |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Trigger Time** | When the environmental deviation occurred | Establishes cue onset |
| **Trigger Type** | Type of deviation (IAQ, VOC, temperature) | Context for stimulus |
| **Response Time** | When the dial first moved | Measures awareness & attention |
| **Resolution Time** | When clarity was restored | Reflects motor control & engagement |
| **Response Latency** | Time from cue to first response | Indicator of processing speed |
| **Outcome** | Whether cue was resolved | Binary performance indicator |

All interactions are timestamped and stored (e.g., JSON, CSV, or SQLite) for later analysis.

### Example Log Entry

  "response_latency_s": 14,
  "resolution_duration_s": 21,

}
```

### Research Rationale

#### Gerontology Perspective
- **Procedural Memory Preservation:** The radio-tuning gesture leverages procedural memory, which often remains intact in older adults and those with mild dementia.  
- **Low Cognitive Load:** Simple, familiar motor response requiring no explicit instructions.  
- **Longitudinal Insight:** Gradual changes in response speed or success rate can reflect cognitive or attentional decline.

#### HCI Perspective
- **Objective, Embodied Data:** Provides timestamped, sensor-linked behavioural data without self-report bias.  
- **Non-Intrusive:** The cue remains subtle and self-contained, reducing stress or confusion.  
- **Familiar Tangible Interaction:** Allows study of procedural adaptation and sensory engagement in ageing users.

### Implementation Guidance

For future implementations of logging:

1. **Timestamp Key Events** ‚Äî record `trigger_time`, `response_time`, and `resolution_time` on the MCU (e.g., ESP32).  
2. **Track Dial Movement** ‚Äî detect motion via rotary encoder or potentiometer.  
3. **Compute Metrics** ‚Äî `response_latency = response_time - trigger_time`; `resolution_duration = resolution_time - response_time`.  
4. **Store Securely** ‚Äî log to local file or database; sync securely to research server if needed.  
5. **Export Easily** ‚Äî provide `.csv` or `.json` for data analysis in R, Python, or MATLAB.

### Summary

Interaction logging transforms the AAB from a passive ambient sensor into a **behavioural research instrument**. By recording *how and when* participants respond to subtle environmental changes through a simple tuning action, the AAB provides a new, objective way to study cognition, attention, and adaptation in ageing and cognitively diverse populations.

This system represents a **novel, non-intrusive research instrument** combining **environmental sensing, adaptive feedback, and procedural memory-based interactions** for gerontology and TUI studies.
